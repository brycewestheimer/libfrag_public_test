# libfrag Copilot Directory

This directory contains resources for AI-assisted development of the libfrag quantum chemistry library.

## Directory Structure

- `guidelines.md` - Development guidelines for working with AI assistants
- `chats/` - Conversation logs and important discussions
- `prompts/` - Reusable prompt templates
- `context/` - Project context files to share with AI assistants

## Usage

1. **Before starting development**: Review `guidelines.md` and `context/project-overview.md`
2. **For new features**: Use templates from `prompts/templates.md`
3. **Save important conversations**: Store in `chats/` with descriptive names
4. **Update context**: Keep project context files current as the project evolves

## Adding to Version Control

This directory should generally be excluded from version control (see .gitignore), but you may choose to include:
- Guidelines and templates (`.md` files)
- Important architectural decisions from AI conversations
- Reusable prompt patterns that work well

Personal chat logs and context files can remain local to avoid cluttering the repository.
